Machine Learning Projects 🚀

This repository contains three machine learning projects I built while learning end-to-end workflows, including data cleaning, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

📂 Projects
1. 🏡 Housing Price Prediction

Dataset: California Housing dataset (sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing)

Goal: Predict house prices based on features such as income, population, and location.

Highlights:

Applied linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting.

Experimented with polynomial features and hyperparameter tuning.

Compared different models using R² score and Mean Squared Error.

2. 🌦️ Weather Prediction App

Data Source: OpenWeatherMap API (live weather data).

Goal: Predict likelihood of rain/wind using real-time weather inputs.

Highlights:

Fetched live weather data with API calls.

Used scikit-learn models for prediction.

Worked on feature engineering with historical weather records.

3. 🏋️ Fitness Classification

Dataset: Custom fitness dataset.

Goal: Predict whether a person is fit or not based on health features.

Highlights:

Full pipeline: data cleaning, outlier removal, scaling, encoding, and normalization.

Tried multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and HistGradientBoosting.

Evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Applied ensemble methods for better performance.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Languages: Python 🐍

Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, requests

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Git, GitHub

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Navigate to each project folder and run the Jupyter Notebooks or scripts.

📌 Notes

These are my first from-scratch ML projects — more for learning than production.

Feedback and suggestions are always welcome 🙌
